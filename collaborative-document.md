## The contributions

### David

 530       Staffordshire South

![David's graph of West Midlands constituencies](DavidF-plot.svg)

This plot shows, for all constituencies in the West Midlands region, the relationship between electoral change (between Conservative and Labour parties, at the 2015 and 2017 General Elections) and the percentage of people aged 18-24 according to the 2011 census.

Perhaps surprisingly, gains for Labour (over the Conservatives) appear to have been largest in those West Midlands seats where there were fewest young people resident according to the census.

The majority of West Midlands constituencies show some gain for Labour over Conservative.  The *Staffordshire South* constituency, highlighted in red in the plot, appears to be fairly typical as far as these two variables are concerned.

**The above is just an illustrative example of the sort of graph and text you might include in this file.  I fully expect that some of the graphs you'll produce will be more interesting than this one!**

### Nayia
57 Birmingham Edgbaston

![Nayia's graph (also) of West Midlands constituencies](NayiaC-plot.svg)

Same plot as Prof. Firth's above but now the *Birmingham Edgbaston* constituency is highlighted in red in the plot. 

The *Birmingham Edgbaston* constituency is similar to the majority of constituencies with regards to the Relative LabCon vote ratios between 2015 and 2017, as it shows some gain for Labour over Conservative. However, it differs from the majority of constituencies with regards to the percentage of people aged 18-24 according to the 2011 census in the West Midlands, as it is one of the 4 consituencies with the largest percentage of young people (above 15%).

 The graph shows the relationship between the percentage of the population with a degree in each consituency in West Midlands and the estimated percentage of population that voted leave. As expected, there is a strong relationship between these two variables, where a higher percentage of population having a degree is correlated with a lower percentage of people voting leave. Also, there are some points that are on the outskirts, having both a low percentage of population with a degree and a low percentage of population not turning up to the elections. 
  Focusing on the constituency Walsall North we can see that out of all the constituencies in the West Midlands ithas the highest percentage of population voting leave(well above 70%) and, in agreement with the relationship stated before, the second lowest percentage of population with a degree(under 5%).
